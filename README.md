The purpose of this inclass is to get familiar with classes and using git to do version control.

We will focus on the following:

Using multiple classes in a program
Understanding of what happens when instances are created
Best practices for creating classes
How to make classes use one another through association (aggregate)
How to apply the concepts of git to a Visual Studio program

## Outside Resources Used

## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program

Original Code was written in an older version of Visual Studio (2019), so net5.0 is out of
support, and will not execute in Visual Studio 2022.
